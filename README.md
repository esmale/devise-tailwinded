# Devise::Tailwinded

Based on the Devise Bootstrapped gem (https://github.com/king601/devise-bootstrapped), this gem tries to give you a nicer place to start with your Devise-based views when using Tailwind CSS.

All you need to do is run `rails g devise:views:tailwinded` instead of the normal devise:views.

If you want to switch back to the basic Devise views, just remove the devise views folder and run the normal Devise generator command.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise-tailwinded'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install devise-tailwinded
